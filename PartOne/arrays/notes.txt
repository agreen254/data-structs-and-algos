ARRAY NOTES
Basic Operations:
    Lookup by index -- O(1)
    Insert -- O(n)
    Delete -- O(1) if last ele, O(n) if first ele => O(n) in toto
    Lookup by value -- O(n)
    Java has two implementations of dynamic arrays: Vector and ArrayList
    Vector: grows +100% whenever full, synchronous method (only a single thread can access)
    ArrayList: grows +50% whenever full

Arrays are great when you know how many items you'll have ahead of time
When doing runtime complexity we always consider the worst case scenario
