LINKED LISTS
- A linked list consists of a group of nodes in sequence
- Each node holds two pieces of data: 
    - a value
    - the address of the next node in the list
- First node: head
- Last node: tail
- We have references to the head and tail

- LOOKUP by value: O(n)
- LOOKUP by index: O(n)

- INSERT at end: O(1)
- INSERT at beginning: O(1)
- INSERT at middle: O(n)

- DELETE from beginning: O(1)
- DELETE from end: O(n)
- DELETE from middle: O(n)

- When implementing operations in your data structures, you need to think about efficiency.

- Differences between Arrays and Linked Lists
    - best way is to explain in terms of required memory and time complexity of various operations
    - SPACE
        - static arrays have a fixed size
        - dynamic arrays grow by 50-100% of their original size when they need to grow
        - linked lists don't waste memory like this
        - but each linked list element takes more memory than an array element because it needs to store the address of the next element
        - use arrays if you know the number of items you need to store ahead of time because arrays have a smaller footprint
        - e.g. if you know you need to store up to 100 items you should use a dynamic array new ArrayList(100)
    - There are always trade-offs!! No one tool is 100% correct
    - Explain the pros and cons of each and pick the best fit!
    - COMPLEXITY
        - arrays shine when you need to look up an item by an index
        - linked lists have to traverse until this
        - but inserting an element to the front or back is better in a linked list
        - deleting items in an array is always O(n)
        - deleting the beginning item in a linked list is an O(1), but others require traversing and are O(n)

- Two types of linked lists: Singly and Doubly
    - SINGLY: every node has a pointer to the next node
    - DOUBLY: every node has a pointer to the next node AND a pointer to the previous node
    - removing from the end of a doubly-linked list is O(1) instead of O(n)
    - however, doubly-linked lists need to have an extra field and take more memory
    - LinkedList class in java is an implementation of doubly-linked lists

- Both doubly and singly-linked lists can be circular
- being circular means the last node references the first
- e.g. a looping playlist
