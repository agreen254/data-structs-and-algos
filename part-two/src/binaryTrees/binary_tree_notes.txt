Binary Trees
- A tree is a data structure that stores elements in a hierarchy
    - each node contains some data, e.g. a Person object
    - we refer to the elements as 'nodes' and the lines that connect them as 'edges'
    - the top node of the tree is called the 'root'
    - nodes can have both a parent node and children nodes
    - nodes at the very bottom of the tree with no children are called 'leaf'

- When each node only has a max of two children it is called a 'Binary Tree'

- We use trees whenever we want to represent hierarchical data
- Database management tools also use trees for indexing data
- Autocompletion engines use trees too
- Also compilers -- they use a special kind of tree called a "syntax tree" to parse expression
- And compression algorithms such as those used in JPEG and MP3

- In a binary search tree, the value of any node is always greater than that of its left child and less than that of its right child
- Every node in the left sub-tree is smaller than the root
- Every node in the right sub-tree is larger than the root
- Binary search trees follow Logarithmic Time Complexity for lookups; i.e. O(log n)
    - for additions: O(log n) -- we just have to find a node, which is O(log n), then set the link O(1)
    - for deletions: O(log n) -- we look it up then remove it by deleting its edges
