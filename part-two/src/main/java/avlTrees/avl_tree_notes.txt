AVL Trees
Balanced vs Unbalanced
- Binary tree operations are only O(log n) if the tree is balanced
- By balanced, we mean that height(left) - height(right) <= 1
- A perfect tree is a tree where everything but the leaves is full of nodes
- Can also have right skewed/left skewed trees
- We need to have trees that balance themselves to avoid skewing
- Self-balancing trees include:
    - AVL Trees (Adelson-Velsky and Landis)
    - Red-black Trees
    - B-Trees
    - Splay-Trees
    - 2-3 Trees

- If the height difference in an AVL tree is greater than one following an insertion, then the tree will re-balance itself using something called rotation.
- Four types of rotations:
    - Left (LL)
    - Right (RR)
    - Left-Right (LR)
    - Right-Left (RL)

    reset height of root/newRoot
    change return type of balance method to an AVLNode
