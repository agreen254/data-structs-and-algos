QUEUES
- Data structure similar to a stack, except the first item inserted is the first item removed
- FIFO (First In, Last Out)
- Stacks are LIFO (Last In, First Out)
- Like a cafeteria line in the real world
- Applications:
    - you have a resource which must be shared among many consumers
    - printer jobs
    - operating systems (to manage process running)
    - web servers (to manage incoming requests)
    - live support systems

- Supported Operations (all are implemented in the Queue interface)
    - enqueue (implemented as add() and offer() in Java. If the queue is full, add() will throw an exception and offer() will not)
    - dequeue (poll() and remove() ; remove() will throw an exception if called on an empty object and poll() will not)
    - peek (peek() and element() ; peek() returns null if the queue is empty, but element() will throw an exception)
    - isEmpty
    - isFull
    - ALL are O(1) because items are only added/removed from the end

- In Java, the java.util.Queue is just an Interface and doesn't have a full implementation
- 90% of the time you will use the ArrayDeque or the LinkedList
- That's right, a LinkedList uses the Queue Interface!
- ArrayDeque:
    - short for Double Ended Que
    - it has two ends
    - you can add items from any direction
    - internally, this class uses a resizable array to store the items

- There are three ways to implement a queue:
    - store the items in an array, a linked list, or a stack

- If you make a queue from two stacks, enqueue is O(1) but dequeue and peek can be O(n) if you need to pop the entire first queue

- Priority Queues
    - tasks are completed based on their priority, not on when they were added to the queue
    - two ways to implement: Arrays and Heap
