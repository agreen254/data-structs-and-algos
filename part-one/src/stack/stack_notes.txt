STACKS
- Many uses such as
    - implementing the undo feature
    - building compilers (e.g. syntax checking)
    - evaluate arithmetic expressions (e.g. calculator, 1 + 2 * 3)
    - build navigation (forward/back)

- Stacks are like a stack of books
    - we can stack a bunch of books on top of each other
    - but we can only read or remove the top book from the stack
    - getting to the bottom book requires removing all of the books one by one

- LIFO (Last In First Out) Principle
    - suppose each item in the stack represents an action that a user performed in a text editor
    - to undo these actions we start with the most recent action
    - we take this action out of the stack and call one of its methods to undo that action

- Internally, we use an array or a linked list to store the objects in a stack
- A stack is basically a wrapper around an array or a linked list that gives us a different way of storing and accessing objects

- OPERATIONS
    - push(item): Adds an item on top of the stack
    - pop(): Removes most recent item
    - peek(): Returns top item without removing it from the stack
    - isEmpty(): Tells us if the stack is empty or not
    - notice the absence of lookup methods

    - peek: O(1)
    - isEmpty: O(1)
    - push: O(1)
    - pop: O(1)
